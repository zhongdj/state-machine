State Machine is a classical methodology for modeling reactive object's life cycle.

Actually everyone is dealing with life cycle in everyday, of course including programming.

A well defined life cycle will help to build a strong life, which brings benifits like: 

1.Behaviors happening in desired order to keep consistent with designed.
2.Good support for reactive metrics, especially relating to different states.
3.Robust, there won't be transient state eventually, every running state has to come to an end.
4.Etc.

Life cycle design activity is the basis of programming and modeling, and UML has state diagram to describe a state machine of a reactive object.

This project is going to componentize the "life cycle" management and connect the modeling behavior with programming behavior at application framework level support.
